# Disease Prediction Website using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a **Disease Prediction Website** powered by **Machine Learning**. It allows users to input symptoms and receive a predictive diagnosis based on trained ML models. The goal is to provide a preliminary health assessment and encourage early medical consultation.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive web-based UI for easy symptom entry.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes ML algorithms to predict possible diseases based on symptoms.
- **Multiple Disease Prediction**: Covers a range of common diseases based on dataset availability.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Uses historical medical data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Provides quick results with minimal user input.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django for API handling)
- **Machine Learning**: Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL (if storing user data)
- **Deployment**: Flask/Django, Docker, AWS/Heroku (if deployed)

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users enter their symptoms through a simple form.
2. **ML Processing**: The model processes the input and predicts the possible disease.
3. **Results Display**: The website displays predicted disease(s) along with possible recommendations.
4. **Next Steps**: Suggests consulting a doctor for further diagnosis.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the website.

## Dataset

The ML model is trained on a publicly available healthcare dataset that maps symptoms to diseases.
